Welcome to SUPER TIC-TAC-TOE!

This program plays out as regular Tic Tac Toe, but with a twist. Every 'n' placements (decided by user), the first placement for that player will be removed.
For example, if player 'X' placed an X at (X1, Y1), then played his fourth X when 'n' is 3, the X at (X1, Y1) would be removed.

This program utilizes Hashing, as well as dynamic Linked-List's as auxilary storages.

This program was built for both maximum time AND space complexities, with most functions being O(1) or O(N) worst case. It beats a 2d array, to say the least.

The language is Java
