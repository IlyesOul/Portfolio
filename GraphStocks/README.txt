Welcome to my Stock Grapher and Suggestor 9000Â®!

This project has two main behaviors: graphing a certain attribute (low, high, open, close, volume) of ANY stock within a certain time interval.
The only limitations in this fetuare is the time that the API used extends to.
The other main feature is an analysis on a users stock portfolio.
I originally intended to use Machine Learning to predict and classify certain attributes of a stock, but it became prevelant that this wouldn't be possible,
as there were no labels on the data transmitted from the API.
With no ML, the program will use mathematics and user input to decide which stocks in their portfolio are per their "logisitic" requirments.

This project utilizes an extensive Yahoo! Finance API, dictionaries, loops, functions, user input, matplotlib, and JSON translations
